# California Housing – Linear Models Practice

Small practice project with basic linear models on the California Housing dataset:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge (with and without GridSearchCV)
- Lasso

The script:
- loads the dataset from `sklearn.datasets`,
- scales features,
- trains the models,
- prints R², MSE and RMSE for each model.

(small neat thing, yeah)
